0,"Hey, Soul Sister",Train,"Hey, hey, hey
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of
My left side brain
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind

Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind.

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move
Ain't fair you know

Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time
I'm so glad
You have a one track
Mind like me.

You gave my life direction
A game show love connection
We can't deny

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat
Right out my untrimmed chest

I believe in you.
Like a virgin
You're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move
Ain't fair you know

Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you is the only drug I need
You're so gangsta
I'm so thug
You're the only one
I'm dreaming of you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be
With me

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move
Ain't fair you know

Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey
Tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Tonight"
1,Love The Way You Lie,Eminem,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it, “Wait!
Where you going?”, “I'm leaving you.” “No, you ain't
Come back!” We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me when it comes to love
You're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

Wake up in the morning feelin' like P Diddy (hey, what up, girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)

'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

4,Just the Way You Are,Bruno Mars,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah"

7,Secrets,OneRepublic,"Secrets (secrets) are no fun
Secrets (secrets) hurt someone
Let me tell you how it all began
A little secret got out of hand

I ran into him just by chance
At this party we were talking then we started to dance
The music banging' then he leaned in close
My mind is telling' me that I should go (but I stayed)

In a moment of weakness (a mistake)
But I kept it a secret
Soon enough I found
Secrets have a way of getting out

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise if you'll just come back to me I swear no secrets, no deceit
I'll be your angel oh so sweet no secrets will I keep

Every night I light a candle
Every morning well I say a little prayer
In hopes that when I open my eyes
I will find you standing there

I confess a crime against our love
My loneliness is punishment enough
Forgiveness is Devine
Everyone keeps secrets sometimes

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

Angels in heaven above
I know I've sinned against love
Grant me this one miracle
And I'll be a saint from now on

Look in my eyes and it's that that you see it
It's been two weeks since my confession
And still he's not back in my arms
My love for you is the truth cause my heart keeps no secrets
Heaven just give me a sign; tell me his heart is still mine

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise no secrets forever ever more

Cross my heart and hope to die
I swear these lips will never tell another lie
If you could love me like you did before
I promise
I promise no secrets forever more"
8,Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down,Alicia Keys,"Ooh, New York
Ooh, New York

Grew up in a town
That is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean
If I could make it here
I could make it anywhere
That's what they say
Seeing my face in lights
Or my name in marquees
Found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
The big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

On the avenue
There ain't never a curfew
Ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot
On the corner selling rock
Preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab
Takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger
For more than from an empty fridge

I'm going to make it by any means
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
The big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say yeah, yeah

In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
The big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York"

12,Cooler Than Me - Single Mix,Mike Posner,"If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause, you think you're cooler than me
You got your hot crowd
Shoes on your feet
And you wear them around
Like they ain't shit
But you don't know
The way that you look
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise
Sh
I got you
All figured out
You meet everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain
You probably think that this song is about you
Don't you?
Don't you?
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause, you think you're cooler than me
You got your hot crowd
Switching your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know
The way that you look
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise
Sh
See, I got you
All figured out
You meet everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain
You probably think that this song is about you
Don't you?
Don't you?
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause
You think you're cooler than me
And don't you dare act like you don't know, (Don't know,)
Know what's up, (Know What's up,)
Cause your nose is up
I'm approaching up. (Yup)
Like I can't give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter
Miami in December
Trying to look bored in them diors.(Diors)
She probably is
Was acting shallow until
She find out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Pre-Madonna
This is your reminder
That I think you're fine
But I'm finer
Cause it sure seems
Cause it sure seems
You got no doubt
That you got no doubt
But we all seem
We all seem
We got your head
In the clouds
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say hey
Or remember my name
It's probably cause you think you're cooler than me"

19,Your Love Is My Drug,Kesha,"Maybe I need some rehab, 
or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession, 
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley, 
I'm making us desperate 'cause
I'm staying up all night hoping 
And hitting my head against the wall

What you got boy it's hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
But love to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgments getting kinda hazy
My esteem is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick cracker

What you got boy it's hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do you wanna make it hot, beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love with your drug?

Your drug, uh your drug
Uh your drug is my love, your drug
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
Hey... so?
Your love, your love, your love, is my drug

Take a bite of my heart tonight.
Oh oh I want some more Oh oh What are we waitin' for?
What are we waitin' for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight.

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's gettin heavier and I wanna run and hide,
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time you're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you the animal inside of you

Oh, oh I want some more Oh, oh What are you waitin' for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight.
Oh oh I want some more Oh oh What are we waitin' for?

Hush hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess why can't you understand?
Woah I won't sleep tonight, I wont sleep tonight
Here we go again... Here we go again... Here we go again...

Oh, oh I want some more oh oh What are you waitin' for?

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I'll let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back

Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'mma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight...)

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on

29,California Gurls,Katy Perry,"[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
(Uh!) The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representing California (Ooh ooh)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle

Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock

Let's do it baby, let's do it baby
Let's do it, do it

[Verse]
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Post-Chorus]
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

[Verse]
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right til the end
Ooh

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Bridge]
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

39,Dog Days Are Over,Florence + The Machine,"Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with her drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can't you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
and what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the head
Struck from a great height
by someone who should know better than that

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can't you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your loving behind
You cant carry it with you if you want to survive

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can't you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run"
40,Something's Got A Hold On Me - Burlesque Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,Christina Aguilera,
41,Doesn't Mean Anything,Alicia Keys,"Used to dream about being a millionaire, 
Without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
Cause it's over, that just won't be fair, darling

Rather be a poor woman living on the street,
No food to eat
Cause I don't want nobody if I have to cry
Cause it's over when you said goodbye

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

Now I see myself through different eyes, 
it's no surprise
Being alone would make you realize
When it's over, all in love is fair
I shoulda been there, I should been there, 
I shoulda, shoulda

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone

I know I push you away
What can I do that will say how I love
Take these material things
They don't mean nothing
It's you that I want

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone
(I shoulda been there, I should been there,
I shoulda, shoulda)

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything now that you're gone
From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn't mean anything since you're gone"

No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'mma rock this shit like fashion, as in going til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town
I shut it down. Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard


[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me -- go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" -- they trying to clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Mane""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be

[Outro: Rihanna]
Where them girls talking trash?
Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at?

44,You Lost Me,Christina Aguilera,"I am done, smoking gun
We've lost it all, the love is gone
She has won. Now it's no fun
We've lost it all, the love is gone

And we had magic
And this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

(Chorus:)
I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We found our life's been changed
Babe, you lost me

And we tried, oh how we cried
We lost ourselves, the love has died
And oh, we tried, you can't deny
We're left as shells, we lost the fight

And we had magic
And this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

(Chorus:)
I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We found our life's been changed
Babe, you lost me

Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet
But you chose lust when you deceived me
You'll regret it but it's too late
How can I ever trust you again?

(Chorus:)
I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We found our life's been changed
Babe, you lost me"
45,Not Myself Tonight,Christina Aguilera,"You know tonight
I am feeling a little out control
Is this me
You wanna get crazy
Because I don't give a...

I'm out of character
I'm in rare form
And If you really knew me
You'd know its not the norm

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone I feel brand new
And if you don't like it f*** you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl

I'm dancing a lot and I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls
Someone call the doctor cause I lost my mind

Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone I feel brand new
And if you don't like it fuck you

The music's on and I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care cause this is my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl

In the morning
When I wake up
I'll go back to the girl I used to be
But baby not tonight

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl same girl

Yah, that feels good
I needed that
Get crazy
Let's go
That's right
Come on
Give it to me now, don't stop"
46,Written in the Stars (feat. Eric Turner),Tinie Tempah,"Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Lets go
Yeah
You're listening now
They say they aint heard nothing like this in a while
Thats why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
So When they see me everybody brrrrrap's, brrrrrraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look im just a writer from the ghetto like malory blackman
Where the hells all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
Thats why you have to keep screaming til they hear you out

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never took because we needed a change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyones a kid that no-one cares about
You just got to keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way"

She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Yeah"
55,Rolling in the Deep,Adele,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
With the beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind 
And reap just what you sow
We could've had it all
We could've had it all
It all, it all it all,

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
  But you played it,you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Everytime you touch me I just melt away

Now everybody ask me why I'm smiling up
From ear to ear
(They say that love hurts)
But I know
(It's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

Baby it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you

As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gonna do now?""
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home

68,Price Tag,Jessie J,"[Intro: Jessie J]
Okay, Coconut Man, Moonhead and Pea
You ready?

[Verse 1: Jessie J]
Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that?
Yeah, we're paying with love tonight

[Chorus: Jessie J]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

[Verse 2: Jessie J]
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only one getting tired?
Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that?
Yeah, we're paying with love tonight

[Chorus: Jessie J]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well, keep the price tag and take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a half stack
And you can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And it's within 30 seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gon stumble and fall, never
Waiting to see this in the sign of defeat, uh-uh
So we gon keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing

[Chorus: Jessie J]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the, uh, cha-ching, cha-ching
Ain't about the, yeah, ba-bling, ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

69,Good Life,OneRepublic,"Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone

New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me
What there is to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

Hopelessly
I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly
I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly
I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cuz hopelessly
The hope is we have so much to feel good about

Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life

Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado

Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me
What there is to complain about"

I can't take one more sleepless night without you

If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you

Lost my heart, I lost my mind without you

I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same without you

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you'll never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns or wedding bells in the attic

Get Ginger ready
Climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seats with my heels
Cause that's where we make love

Come on and run
Turn the car on and run

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore
 
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night 

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the nigh

Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

I'm gonna marry 
Marry 
I'm gonna marry 
Marry 
C'mon, c'mon 
Tonight 

Night, night, night..."
87,1+1,Beyoncé,
88,Hold It Against Me,Britney Spears,"[Verse 1]
Hey, over there, please forgive me
If I’m coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you’re winning
And they’re playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I’m crazy
But you know I’m just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There’s a spark in-between us
When we’re dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I’m asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

[Interlude - Spoken]
If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

[Bridge]
Give me something good
Don’t wanna wait, I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out

[Breakdown]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?"

Okay, I’m into you, like you never knew
I’m falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You’re way too fly, I could be your jet fuel

Every finish line is the beginning of a new race

A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Lets go
Yeah
You're listening now
They say they aint heard nothing like this in a while
Thats why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
So When they see me everybody brrrrrap's, brrrrrraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look im just a writer from the ghetto like malory blackman
Where the hells all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
Thats why you have to keep screaming til they hear you out

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never took because we needed a change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyones a kid that no-one cares about
You just got to keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way

Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way"
94,Jar of Hearts,Christina Perri,"I know I can't take one more step towards you
Cause all that's waiting is regret
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

Dear, it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are?
Running around leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?"

96,Turning Page,Sleeping At Last,"I've waited a hundred years
But I'd wait a million more for you
Nothing prepared me for the privilege of being yours
If I had only felt the warmth within your touch
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough
I would have known what I've been living for all along
What I've been living for

Your love is my turning page
Only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefining phrase
I surrender who I've been for who you are
Nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
I would have known what I've been living for all along
What I've been living for

We're tethered to the story we must tell
When I saw you well I knew we'd tell it well
With the whisper we will tame the vicious scenes
Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees"

101,Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.),Katy Perry,"There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
There's a hickie or a bruise

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a black top blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn!

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah

This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn!

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credits card
And got kicked out of the bars
So we hit the boulevards

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Oh whoa oh

This Friday night
Do it all again
Do it all again (This Friday night)

Do it all again
Do it all again (This Friday night)

T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
Oh-whoa-oh

This Friday night
Do it all again"
102,Firework,Katy Perry,"[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
C'mon, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
C'mon, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Outro]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon"

106,Paradise,Coldplay,"When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooohh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on
It gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night
The stormy night
She closed her eyes
In the night
The stormy night
Away she flied

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

She dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

La-la-la-la-la

Still lying underneath the stormy skies
She said oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I know the sun's set to rise

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise

107,Payphone,Maroon 5,"I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of sh*t
One more stupid love song I'll be sick

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of sh*t
One more stupid love song I'll be sick

Now I'm at a payphone

[Wiz Khalifa]
Man work that sh*t
I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with the push up a button
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now ask me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of sh*t with you

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of sh*t
One more stupid love song I'll be sick

Now I'm at a payphone"

Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh oh
You don't know you're beautiful oh oh
But that's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

109,I Knew You Were Trouble.,Taylor Swift,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down

Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear comes creepin' in
That you never loved me or her or anyone,
 or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down

Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

110,Call Me Maybe,Carly Rae Jepsen,"I threw a wish in the well,
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way

I trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin',
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call,
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all,
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
Have foresight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it,
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin',
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one

A sinful, miracle, lyrical
You've saved my life again
And I want you to know baby

You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are and I want you to know baby

112,Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,"I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
It was dark and I was over,
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet,

But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,

When I lay with you I could stay there,
Close my eyes,
Feel you here forever,
You and me together, nothing is better,

'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames,
Well, It felt something died,
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught, must be waiting for you,
Even now when we're already over,
I can't help myself from looking for ya,

I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touch your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames,
Well, I felt something died,
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh,
Oh, no,
Let it burn, oh,
Let it burn,
Let it burn."
113,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,Taylor Swift,"I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, this is it, I've had enough
'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oh we called it off again last night
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oh, you called me up again tonight
But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever, ever getting back together
We, are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, never say never
Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together like, ever

(No!) We are never ever, ever getting back together
We, are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we, are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, are not getting back together,

Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

Think you got the best of me
Think you had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over with someone new
But told you I was moving on over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not a broken hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking bout me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end...

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

How it's all turned to lies
Sometimes I think that it's better,
To never ask why

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns, doesn't mean you're gonna die
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns, doesn't mean you're gonna die
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

Ever worry that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by
Tell me are you just getting by, by, by

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns, doesn't mean you're gonna die
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
Gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

You gotta get up and try, and try, and try
You gotta get up and try, and try, and try

You and I go rough
We keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so
Damn dysfunctional we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick
Yeah, I know that we can't do this no more, eh

But baby there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head
 Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body
 Like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid
Crawling back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you no
 But my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'd be waking up
In the morning probably hating myself
And I'd be waking up
Feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell, eh

But baby there you go again, there you go again
 Making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head, using my head
 Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body

When we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang
To Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday
We got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parent's liquor
And climb to the roof
Talk about our future
Like we had a clue
Never planned that one day
I'd be losing you

In another life,
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was june and you were my johnny cash
Never one without the other
We made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown
Singing the blues
It's time to face the music
I'm no longer your muse

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say
You were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one

The one that got away

All this money
Can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you
What you meant to me, whoa
'cause now I pay the price

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world

And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope they'll still be there

My brother and my sister slept
In another place
The only time I feel safe

Asking about a scar and,

I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back

So if by the time

And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home...

All that you got

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
Cause I found someone to carry me home

So will someone come
And carry me home

Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up and I can do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game
You fired a shot in my heart

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up
Love (lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up
Love (lift me up)

I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best and it's not you
You broke my heart, but you can't bring me down
I was falling apart, what was lost, now I'm found
I picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

Took me to heaven and let me fall down
Now that it's over
I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up, and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on
Living for love
I'm living for love
Not gonna stop
Love's gonna lift me up
Love (lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up
Love (lift me up)

Love's gonna lift me up
Lift me up
Cause love's gonna lift me up
Up, up, up
Love lifts me up, up, up, up
Cause love's gonna lift me up
Up, up, up
Love lifts me up
Love's gonna lift me up
Love lifts me up, up, up, up

Living for love
Living for love
I'm not giving up
I'm gonna carry on

348,Don't Be so Hard on Yourself,Jess Glynne,"I came here with a broken heart
That no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
The wounds heal and tears dry
And cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Because I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
So how can this dark cloud be raining over me
But heart breaks
And hell's a place that everyone knows
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Because I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Oh, Oh, Oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But now know I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more

Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Because I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Let loss reveal it
Let loss reveal it

St Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St Jude, we were lost before she started
St Jude, we lay in bed
 as she whipped around us
St Jude
Maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos

And I was on the island and you were there too
But somehow through the storm
I couldn't get to you
Oh St Jude, somehow she knew
And she came to give her blessing
While causing devastation
And I couldn't keep my mouth shut,
 I just had to mention
Grabbing your attention

St Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St Jude, we were lost before she started

Hey, let's get it now

Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
(Ne-yo, let's get it)
Let's get it now

This is the last $20 I got
But I'mma have a good time ballin' or out
Tell the barteneder line up some shots
Cause I'mma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a Squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up

355,Sparks,Hilary Duff,"I can't hear a single word
Just know you're talking 'cause your lips keep movin'
Everything I though I learned
Goes out the window, all I want is one thing

You can promise castles, treasures
Babies, I don't care
'Cause for now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath
Right on my neck
You remember what I love
So baby take me back

Turn the lights down low
And kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me
Baby, I see sparks

You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

Ticking, tocking like a bomb
Throws me back to when I had you closer
Skin to skin we get it on
Without the love I feel you going bolder

You can promise castles, treasures
Babies, I don't care
'Cause for now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath
Right on my neck
You remember what I love
So baby take me back

Turn the lights down low
And kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me
Baby, I see sparks

You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go

Take it all off
From every inch of you
Traveling back in time
Tangled up tight just like
We used to
Now do that thing I like

Turn the lights down low
And kiss me in the dark
'Cause when you're touching me
Baby, I see sparks

You make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go
You
You, you make my heart go"

Baby, turn around for Mr. Put It Down
Went from the block to the yacht to the G4
Down in D.R. jet took a detour
Not from Maryland but when it comes to women
There can always be more

Baby, nice to meet you

357,Legendary Lovers,Katy Perry,"Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly
Looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding
And bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something
So magical tonight

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary

Go down in history, go down together
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love
A ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly
Looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding
And bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something
So magical tonight

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers
We could be legendary
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary

Under the river

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Inside of someone else's place
Pull away your eyes there's nothing left to heal
I'm alone but I know everything you feel

And you waited on the rain

And we fall through fate
But we rise and rise again
And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Tell me how you closed the door
Knowin' nobody could love you more
Tellin' all your friends that this love
Was just made for bleedin'
Hung up underwater but still we keep on
Tryin' to breath in

And you waited on the rain
Through tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate
But we rise and rise again
And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run

372,7 Years,Lukas Graham,"Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends
 Or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

It was a big big world,
 But we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits,
 We were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb
 And drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out
 To make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old
 My daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife
 Or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream
 Like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs,
 I started writing stories
Something about that glory
 Just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love
 Will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old,
 My story got told
Before the morning sun,
 When life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

(lukas graham!!!)

I only see my goals,
 I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices,
 They can make it major
I got my boys with me
 At least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave,
 I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old,
 My story got told
I was writing about everything,
 I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old,
 Our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world
 And we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old,
 My daddy got 61
Remember life
 And then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when
 I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit,
 Once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old,
 Will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children
 Who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old,
 Will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children
 Who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old,
 My momma told me
Go make yourself some friends
 Or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Girl gotta work for me
Can you make it clap, no hands for me?
Take it to the ground, pick it up for me
Look back at it all over me
Put in work like my timesheet
She ride it like a '63
I'mma buy her no Celine
Let her ride in a foreign with me
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo
And she down to break the rules
La-di-da she gon' go
I won't judge, she finesse
I pipe her, she take that
Putting overtime on your body

375,Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deep within the eyes, can't find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cuddle woes away
Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, cover girls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and beauty is everything
What's a little bit of hunger? ""
I could go a little while longer, she fades away
She don't see her perfect
she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deep within the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shine's within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful"
376,Like I'm Gonna Lose You (feat. John Legend),Meghan Trainor,"I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
we were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then
I was all alone

I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted 'cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time so I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

[John Legend:]
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know

So I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regrets

So let's take our time
To say what we want
Use what we got
Before it's all gone
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted 'cause we'll never know when

Chagrin d'ego, J'en ai ma dose
J'vois désormais ma vie en Rose

Marre du point mort, J'passe la première
Gare si je mords, mais plus la poussière

We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together

Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided

To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying
Baby, I did too
But when the sun came up
I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up
You were looking at me

You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me

Oh, you will see me thrive
Can write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

Oh ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ""you're out of time. ""
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in, think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say

Oh ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, ""you're out of time. ""
But still, I rise
This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in, think again
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

Don't doubt it, don't doubt

Still rise
Just fight it, just fight it

This another hit, I got an ace in the hole
Boys on my back, playa did you peep that?
You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that
I'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak
Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump
Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue

The dance you doing is dumb
How they do where you from
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit looks fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I come into this bitch like liquid
Drip, drip, drip, then the business
Click, click, get the picture
Hermés Trismegistus
Witness and get lifted
Basic, nigga I was born in the basement
Shape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship
False, oh-nah-nah-nah
I am so different than ya'll
So far apart
The way that I balance the bars
I never fall
And if I do I just call
The almighty yellow star, God
Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime
Look how I drive, look at my ride
When I go by, smoke in your eyes
So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys
And you ain't gotta be a mason in the see through
Some of this shit on occasion

The dance you doing is dumb
How they do where you from
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit looks fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak
Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack
Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack
I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse
Yeah when I rap they be all on my jack
Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat
Got a new idea, let me switch it
Man, I'm so futuristic
Big lips and big, big, big hips
Body be thick like a bisque
I'm different, rippin' shit
Microphone grippin' it
Gettin' these Benjamins
New car, whippin' it
I'm so far ahead of ya'll
Man I'm on top of the stars
I don't care who none of you are
Blah-blah-blah, you best to go rewrite your bars

Shawty what?
How they do it where you from?
How they do it where you from?
That's how they do it where we from
That how they do it where they from
Shawty what?
How they do it where you from?
How they do it where you from?
That's how they do it where we from
That how they do it where they from"
419,Desire,Years & Years,"I must be tough
I must behave, I must keep fighting
Don't give it up
I want to keep us compromising

Open your arms and pray
To the truth that you're denying
Give into the game
To the sense that you've been hiding

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feelin' for you?
I want desire
Because your love only gets me abused

Chasing that rush
I need to show what you've been missing
Give me your touch
All of your love is not forbidden

Where are you taking me?
I can't be blamed
I want you to want me again

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feelin' for you?
I want desire
Because your love only gets me abused

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feelin' for you?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose

You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me, you need it now
You know that you've got me
You've locked me down
You tell me you want me now

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feelin' for you?
I want desire
Because your love only gets me abused

Is it desire
Or is it love that I'm feelin' for you?
I want desire
I wanna see what you're willing to lose"
420,When We Were Young,Adele,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young"

423,Hurts,Emeli Sandé,"Baby I'm not made of stone
It hurts
Loving you the way I do
It hurts

Hold tight it's a sing-a-long
I'm alright, I'm alright
But I could be wrong, baby
I know you remember me
5'3 in the back of the lavory, come on
You could at least try to look at me
Oh man, oh man
What a tragedy, ha ha
Bang, bang
There goes paradise
I chill
Why we always had to roll the dice, la la
Heartbeat in the regular
Two seats in the back of the cinema, hazy
Ah yeah, you're forgetting it
And all the mad shit we did after that, crazy
Your heart, calm as ever
I swear you're giving me shivers, shivers

Baby I'm not made of stone
It hurts
Loving you the way I do
It hurts
When all that's left to do is watch
It burns
Oh baby, I'm not made of stone
It hurts

Hold on it's a marathon
Run fast, run fast
Like the rivers run, got it
Never seen in the restaurant
I took a minute till the penny drops, you know
My tears don't fall too often
But your knife is cutting me deep
Deep

Baby I'm not made of stone
It hurts
Loving you the way I do
It hurts
When all that's left to do is watch
It burns
Oh yeah
Baby, I'm not made of stone
It hurts

It hurts the way
That you pretend you don't remember
It hurts the way
That you forget our times together
Like the time
Laid in bed when you said it's forever, baby
I can't, I can't explain no more

Baby I'm not made of stone
It hurts
Oh, loving you the way I do
It hurts
When all that's left to do is watch
It burns
Oh baby, I'm not made of stone
It hurts

Oh baby, I'm not made of stone
It hurts
Loving you the way I do
It hurts"
424,Change,Christina Aguilera,"When I was young I would look in the mirror
Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer
That I remember being filled with such wonder
Before learning that the world can be harsher

Ooh, ooh
Who you love or the colour of your skin
Or the place that you were born and grew up in
Shouldn't decide how you will be treated
'Cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing

Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
Waiting for hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change
Change, change

For all the brave and the souls who went before us
Stand tall, then proudly lift your voices
Let 'em know who we are and our choices
And one day we won't have to sing this chorus

Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
Waiting for hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change
Change (oh), change (hold on)
Waiting for a change, change

When I was young I would look in the mirror
Didn't see it then but now it couldn't be clearer"

This feeling, I wanna go with it
'Cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game
Just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No rules
From the bar to the car
Let's take it back to my room
Igniting the heat of the moment
Let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we're burning bright
When we cut the light

Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)

I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or little bars
Really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are; need you
I've always wondered what was off limits
Staring at you til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this was all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we could tell that there's changes coming
See I could tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go
Like Penelope in ""Blow""
Well worth the stealing you, it's a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

And make me ooh (move), ooh, ooh (yeah), ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, cause you're the spark that won't go out

Ever since you came I'm livin'

And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive

You crept in and showed me how
Never let me hit the ground
All the love was hesitating
But ever since you came around
I feel more than safe and sound, yeah

Ever since you came I'm livin'

435,One Call Away (feat. Tyga) - Remix,Charlie Puth,
436,Beautiful Birds (feat. Birdy),Passenger,"Do you remember when we were two beautiful birds?
We would light up the sky when we'd fly
You were orange and red like the sun when it sets
I was green as an apple's eye

You said you loved all the songs that I'd sing
Like nothing that you'd ever heard
And I said I loved you with all of my heart when
We were two beautiful birds

Do you remember when we were two beautiful birds
We would sing when the morning would come
You were silver and blue like the moon when it's new
I was gold as a summer sun

But one day you asked for a different song
One that I just couldn't sing
I got the melody sharp and the words all wrong
Those were the last days of spring

To build a nest we pecked
Feathers from our chests
Like a book tearing out every page
We weren't to know that these feathers would grow
Into a beautiful cage"
437,Little Lies,Hilary Duff,"If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day to believe in you

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Tell me, tell me lies
Tell me, tell me lies

Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand there's a reason why
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart let's give it a try

Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

Tell me, tell me lies
Tell me, tell me lies

440,Picky - Remix,Joey Montana,
441,Behind Your Back,Nelly Furtado,
442,Million Years Ago,Adele,"I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly
 Learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor

I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I had grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago"
443,Shape of You,Ed Sheeran,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop

So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop

In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say 
You'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving
That you're missing

Would be everything I need
And this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you baby
Heart old and testified
Tell me that I'm not crazy

I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride Is all I got
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free

Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy
Mercy on my heart

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free

I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
On my heart
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
On my heart"

Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

453,It Ain't Me (with Selena Gomez),Kygo,"I had a dream
We were sipping whisky neat
Highest floor, the bowery
And I was high enough
'Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

No, I don't wanna know where you been
Or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me

It ain't me
It ain't me
It ain't me

I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and the liberties
Never growing up
I'll take with me the polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us

Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me, no no

It ain't me, no no

454,Malibu,Miley Cyrus,"I never came to the beach
Or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore
Under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I try to smile
Hoping I just stay the same
And nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu"

And we both know all the truth I could tell

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you
I found a strength I've never known
I've been thrown out, I've been burned
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name

You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell

I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night
Someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life, you're gonna get
What you give
But some things, only God can forgive

I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace

Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan 
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso

Deja que te diga cosas al oído 
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo 
Despacito 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito 
Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo 
Quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le enseñes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos (Favoritos, favoritos, baby) 
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido 

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo 
Yo sé que estás pensándolo 
Llevo tiempo intentándolo 
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo 
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom 
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza 
¡Oye! 

Despacito 
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito 
Deja que te diga cosas al oído 
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo 
Despacito 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto

464,Paris,The Chainsmokers,"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought ""Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought
""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else""

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a frown
And a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet

Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cutting class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were living in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are

It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes 
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters, 
tell me who do I run to?

Promise I'll be the cure (be the cure)

I'll fix you with my love"
476,"How Far I'll Go - From ""Moana""",Alessia Cara,
477,Bodak Yellow,Cardi B,"Ksr
It's Cardi, ayy
Said, ""I'm the shit,
 they can't fuck with me if they wanted to""

Said, ""Lil bitch,
 you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals, "" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some Bape, I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a groupie, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter as gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
I just a-rove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said, ""Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves"
478,Rich Love (with Seeb),OneRepublic,"I remember talking
And drinking what we could find
Burnin' all those candles
And stayin' up through the night
We'd make reservations for the places
We know we'd never try
But then
We found some rich love

I remember feeling broke as a bottle of wine
I didn't move to the city to count all my pennies
And worship the Hollywood sign
She'd say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you""
But she'd take it in one last time
And I know, cause I found some fake love

Broke as a bottle of wine
But drink with you all damn night
I'm not trying to trade love
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey is just enough
We got some rich love

She'd say, ""Hey man""
She'd say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you""
She'd say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you""
But she'd take it in one last time and I know

Do you remember dancing
The parties out in the yard?
We would piss off the neighbors
They'd eventually call the cops
And I was saving up for something
Hoping life would finally start
'Cause we had some new love

Broke as a bottle of wine
But drink with you all damn night
Broke as a bottle of wine
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love

She'd say, ""Hey man""
She'd say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you""
She'd say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you""
But she'd take it in one last time and I know

We're broke as a bottle of wine
Said, we're broke as a bottle of wine
We're broke as a bottle of wine
Broke as a bottle of wine
Broke as a bottle of wine
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love

She'd say, ""Hey man""
She'd say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you""
Broke as a bottle of wine, broke as a bottle of wine
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love

Broke as a bottle of wine
Broke as a bottle of wine
Broke as a bottle of wine

We're broke as a bottle of wine
Broke as a bottle of wine

Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love"
479,Tired,Alan Walker,"I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

Cold hands, red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
I don't know what came by me

Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
Been waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

And you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don't talk
And if they could, they'd say

Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

If your ghost pulls you up high
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you
when your heart is tired"

Yo yo

You know, I've been taking some time
And I've been keeping to myself (self)
I had my eyes up on the prize
Ain't watching anybody else
But your love, it hit me hard, girl
Yeah, you're bad for my health
I love the cards, that I've been dealt
Do you feel the same as well?

You know, I used to be in 1D (now I'm out, free)
People want me for one thing (that's not me)
I'm not changing, the way, that I (used to be)
I just wanna have fun (and get rowdy)
One Coke and Bacardi (sippin' lightly)
When I walk inside the party (girls on me)
F1 type Ferrari (6 gear speed)
Girl, I love it when your body (grinds on me)
Oh yeah

You know, I love it, when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd
But only you can dance with me
So put your hands on my body
And swing that round for me, baby (swing)
You know, I love it when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love when you hit the ground, girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, strip that down, girl
Love, when you hit the ground

You know, that since the day, I met you
Yeah, you swept me off my feet
You know, that I don't need no money
When your love is beside me
Yeah, you opened up my heart
And then you threw away the key
Girl, now it's just you and me
And you don't care 'bout, where I've been

You know, I used to be in 1D (now I'm out, free) (free)
People want me for one thing (that's not me)

We crossed the line

I've been denying how I feel
You've been denying what you want
You want from me, talk to me baby
I want some satisfaction
Take me to the stars, just say ""oh""

Ah, I wanna cut through the clouds
Break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof
You and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations this is on
I can't make it stop, give me all you got
I want it all or nothing, no more in between
Now give your everything to me
Let's get real baby
A chemical reaction
Take me in your arms and make me ""oh""

Ah, I wanna cut through the clouds
Break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof
You and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way

Show me devotion and take me all the way
